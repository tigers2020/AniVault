# Task ID: 7
# Title: Perform Fuzz Testing and Prepare Accuracy Dataset
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the robustness of the parsing system using property-based fuzz testing with `Hypothesis`. Prepare a labeled sample dataset to evaluate matching accuracy.
# Details:
Create a `Hypothesis` test suite (`hypothesis==6.88.0`) that generates at least 1,000 varied filename-like strings and feeds them to the parsing function, ensuring no unhandled exceptions or crashes occur. Separately, curate and manually label a dataset of 100-200 diverse, real-world filenames with their expected parsing output.

# Test Strategy:
Run the Hypothesis test suite as part of the CI/CD pipeline; it must pass without any falsifying examples. The labeled dataset will be used in a separate test to calculate the matching accuracy score.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Property-Based Test Suite with Hypothesis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a property-based test suite for the parsing function using Hypothesis to ensure robustness
### Details:
Implement property-based tests using Hypothesis to test the parsing function with a wide variety of generated inputs. Define data generation strategies and invariant properties to ensure robust parsing behavior.

## 2. Curate and Label Real-World Filename Dataset [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Curate, manually label, and commit a dataset of at least 100 real-world filenames
### Details:
Collect and manually label a dataset of at least 100 real-world anime filenames with their expected parsing results. This dataset will be used for accuracy evaluation and should cover various formats and languages.

## 3. Implement Accuracy Evaluation Test Script [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a test script that uses the labeled dataset to calculate and report parser accuracy
### Details:
Create a test script that loads the labeled dataset, runs the parsing function on each filename, and calculates accuracy metrics. Report the results including success rate, failure cases, and performance statistics.
