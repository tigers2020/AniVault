# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Core ScanParsePool and Extension Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the main file processing pipeline using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel scanning. Implement a whitelist-based filter to process only relevant file extensions.
# Details:
Create a `ScanParsePool` class that manages a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Implement a directory scanning function that yields file paths. Add a configuration-driven extension whitelist (e.g., .mkv, .mp4, .avi) to filter files before they are queued for parsing.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the extension filter with various file names, including those with and without whitelisted extensions. Integration test the pool by scanning a small directory and verifying that only whitelisted files are submitted to the executor for processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ScanParsePool Class Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core ScanParsePool class using ThreadPoolExecutor
### Details:
Create the main ScanParsePool class that manages a ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel file processing. Define the class structure, initialization, and basic methods for managing the thread pool.

## 2. Implement Basic Directory Scanner [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a directory scanning function that yields file paths for processing
### Details:
Implement a directory scanning function that recursively traverses directories and yields file paths. Use os.scandir for efficient directory traversal and handle various file system edge cases.

## 3. Develop Configuration-Driven Extension Filter [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a whitelist-based filter to process only relevant file extensions
### Details:
Implement a configuration-driven extension filter that only processes files with whitelisted extensions (e.g., .mkv, .mp4, .avi). Make the filter configurable and efficient for large directory scans.

## 4. Write Unit and Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive unit and integration tests for the ScanParsePool functionality
### Details:
Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the complete ScanParsePool workflow. Test various scenarios including edge cases, error handling, and performance characteristics.
