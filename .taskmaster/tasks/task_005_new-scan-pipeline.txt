# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build JSON Cache System v1
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the v1 JSON caching system to store parsing results. This includes the `cache/search/*.json` schema, key normalization, TTL management, and cache hit/miss counters.
# Details:
Create a `CacheManager` class. Implement a key normalization function (e.g., lowercase, remove special characters, whitespace normalization). Before parsing, check the cache. After parsing, store the result in a JSON file at `cache/search/{normalized_key}.json`. Implement TTL by checking the file's modification time. Atomically increment hit/miss counters.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the key normalization algorithm. Integration test the full cache flow: scan a directory, verify cache files are created. Scan it again and assert that the hit counter increases and parsing logic is skipped for cached files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Key Normalization Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to normalize cache keys by converting to lowercase, removing special characters, and standardizing whitespace
### Details:
Implement a key normalization function that takes a query string and returns a normalized version suitable for use as a cache key. This should handle case-insensitive matching, remove special characters, and normalize whitespace.

## 2. Implement Core Cache Read/Write Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create atomic file handling for cache read/write operations with proper error handling
### Details:
Implement the core cache operations including reading from and writing to JSON files. Ensure atomic operations by using temporary files and atomic rename operations to prevent corruption during concurrent access.

## 3. Add TTL (Time-To-Live) Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TTL validation based on file modification times to automatically expire old cache entries
### Details:
Add TTL validation logic that checks file modification times against the current time. Implement cache expiration logic that automatically removes or marks expired entries as invalid.

## 4. Implement Thread-Safe Cache Hit/Miss Counters [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create thread-safe counters for tracking cache performance metrics
### Details:
Implement thread-safe counters using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to track cache hits and misses. These counters should be accessible from multiple threads without race conditions.

## 5. Integrate CacheManager into Main Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the CacheManager into the main processing pipeline to enable caching during file processing
### Details:
Integrate the CacheManager into the main processing pipeline so that parsing results are automatically cached and retrieved. Ensure proper integration with the existing scan and parse workflow.
