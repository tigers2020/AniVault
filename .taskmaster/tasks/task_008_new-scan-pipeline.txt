# Task ID: 8
# Title: Profile Performance and Validate Success Criteria
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct final performance testing to validate that all success criteria are met. Profile memory usage and scan throughput on a large scale, and document the results.
# Details:
Create a test environment with 100k+ files. Use a memory profiler (e.g., `memray`) to execute the scan and verify memory usage remains ≤500MB. Measure the P95 scan throughput in paths/min. Run the scan twice to measure the cache hit rate on the second run. Document all results against the PRD targets.

# Test Strategy:
Execute a dedicated performance benchmark script. The test passes if memory usage is ≤500MB, P95 scan throughput is ≥120k paths/min, and the second-run cache hit rate is ≥90%. The results must be recorded in performance benchmark documentation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Script Creation of 100k+ File Test Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a script to generate a large-scale test environment with 100k+ files for benchmarking
### Details:
Develop a script that can generate a large-scale test environment with 100k+ files for performance benchmarking. The script should create realistic file structures and naming patterns for accurate testing.

## 2. Develop Benchmark Execution Script with Memory Profiler [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a benchmark execution script that measures throughput and integrates memory profiling
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive benchmark execution script that measures scan throughput, memory usage, and cache performance. Integrate memory profiling tools like memray to track memory usage patterns during execution.

## 3. Execute Benchmark and Gather Performance Data [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the benchmark to collect data on throughput, memory, and cache performance
### Details:
Execute the benchmark script on the large-scale test environment to gather comprehensive performance data. Collect metrics on scan throughput, memory usage, cache hit rates, and other relevant performance indicators.

## 4. Analyze Performance Data and Derive Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the collected benchmark data to derive final metrics including P95 and peak memory
### Details:
Analyze the collected performance data to calculate final metrics including P95 scan throughput, peak memory usage, cache hit rates, and other relevant performance indicators. Perform statistical analysis on the results.

## 5. Author Final Performance Report [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive performance report documenting results against project success criteria
### Details:
Create a comprehensive performance report that documents all benchmark results against the project's success criteria. Include detailed analysis, recommendations, and validation of performance targets.
