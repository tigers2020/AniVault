# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement anitopy and Fallback Parsing Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the `anitopy` library for primary filename parsing. Implement a fallback mechanism using the `parse` library for filenames that `anitopy` fails to process.
# Details:
Create a parsing function that takes a filename. First, it attempts to parse with `anitopy==2.1.1`. If the parsing fails or returns insufficient data, it then attempts to parse using a set of predefined patterns with `parse==1.20.0`. The function should log parsing failures and indicate which parser (primary or fallback) was successful.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the parsing function with a diverse set of known filename formats, including complex cases that are expected to require the fallback parser. Track the failure rate against a sample dataset to work towards the â‰¤3% target.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Primary Parsing Logic using anitopy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the primary filename parsing logic using the anitopy library
### Details:
Implement the main parsing logic using the anitopy library to extract anime information from filenames. Handle various filename formats and extract relevant metadata like title, season, episode, quality, etc.

## 2. Design and Implement Fallback Parsing Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a fallback parsing mechanism using the parse library for filenames that anitopy fails to process
### Details:
Implement a fallback parsing mechanism using the parse library with a set of initial patterns for common filename formats. This should handle cases where anitopy fails to extract sufficient information.

## 3. Create Unified Parsing Function with Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a unified parsing function that orchestrates the primary/fallback flow and includes comprehensive logging
### Details:
Implement a unified parsing function that tries the primary anitopy parser first, and falls back to the parse library if needed. Include comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## 4. Build Robust Unit Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive unit test suite with a wide variety of filename examples
### Details:
Create a comprehensive unit test suite that tests the parsing logic with a wide variety of real-world filename examples. Include edge cases, different formats, and various languages to ensure robust parsing.
