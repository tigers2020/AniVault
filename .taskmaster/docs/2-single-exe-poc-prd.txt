# AniVault v3 CLI - Single Executable POC PRD

## Overview
Create a proof-of-concept single executable version of AniVault v3 CLI using PyInstaller, ensuring all critical dependencies are properly bundled and validated on clean Windows environments.

## Goals
- Build a single executable file that includes all dependencies
- Validate PyInstaller compatibility with critical libraries (anitopy, cryptography, tmdbv3api)
- Test executable functionality on clean Windows VMs
- Establish dependency bundling best practices
- Create automated build pipeline for executable generation

## Success Criteria
- Single executable file runs on Windows 7/8/10/11 without additional dependencies
- All critical libraries (anitopy, cryptography, tmdbv3api) work correctly in bundled executable
- Executable size is reasonable (<100MB) and startup time is acceptable (<5 seconds)
- Clean VM testing validates compatibility across Windows versions
- Automated build process for reproducible executable generation

## Technical Requirements

### PyInstaller Configuration
- OneFile mode for single executable
- Hidden imports for all critical dependencies
- Data files inclusion for schemas and templates
- Console mode for CLI application
- Windows-specific optimizations

### Critical Library Validation
1. **anitopy C extension bundling**
   - Verify C extension compilation and bundling
   - Test filename parsing functionality in executable
   - Validate memory usage patterns

2. **cryptography native libraries**
   - Ensure OpenSSL libraries are properly bundled
   - Test encryption/decryption functionality
   - Verify keyring operations

3. **tmdbv3api network functionality**
   - Validate HTTP requests work in bundled executable
   - Test rate limiting and error handling
   - Verify API key storage and retrieval

### Build Process
- Automated spec file generation
- Dependency validation and bundling
- Executable signing preparation
- Size optimization and compression
- Clean VM testing automation

### Testing Requirements
- Windows 7/8/10/11 compatibility testing
- Clean VM environment validation
- Network connectivity testing
- File system operations validation
- Memory usage profiling

## Deliverables
- [ ] PyInstaller spec file configuration
- [ ] Automated build script
- [ ] Dependency bundling validation
- [ ] Clean VM testing setup
- [ ] Executable size and performance benchmarks
- [ ] Build documentation and troubleshooting guide

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Single executable builds successfully with all dependencies
- [ ] Executable runs on clean Windows VMs (7/8/10/11)
- [ ] All critical functionality works in bundled executable
- [ ] Build process is automated and reproducible
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<5s startup, <100MB size)
- [ ] Documentation covers build process and troubleshooting

## Risk Mitigation
- Early testing of critical library bundling
- Fallback options for problematic dependencies
- Multiple Windows version testing
- Automated testing to catch regressions
- Backup build methods (Nuitka) if PyInstaller fails

## Timeline
**Weeks 3-4**: Single executable POC development and validation
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for deployment and distribution
