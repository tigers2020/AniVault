## 📋 **Executive Summary**

Task 1 (Core ScanParsePool and Extension Filtering) has been **successfully completed** with all 4 subtasks delivered. This foundational work establishes the core file processing pipeline using ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel scanning operations, providing a solid foundation for subsequent development phases.

## ✅ **Completed Deliverables**

### 1. **ScanParsePool Class Structure** ✅

  - Thread pool lifecycle management
  - Task submission methods for scanning and parsing
  - Statistics and monitoring capabilities
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. **Basic Directory Scanner** ✅
- **File**: `src/anivault/scanner/file_scanner.py` (enhanced)
- **Features**:
  - New `scan_directory_paths()` function for thread pool integration
  - Yields file paths as strings (not os.DirEntry objects)
  - Generator-based approach for memory efficiency
  - Leverages existing `scan_directory()` for consistency
  - Full type hints and documentation

### 3. **Configuration-Driven Extension Filter** ✅
- **File**: `src/anivault/scanner/extension_filter.py` (new)
- **Features**:
  - Configuration-driven filtering using APP_CONFIG.media_extensions
  - Multiple filter creation functions for different use cases
  - Case-sensitive/insensitive options
  - Advanced pattern-based filtering capabilities
  - Comprehensive validation and error handling

### 4. **Comprehensive Test Suite** ✅
- **File**: `tests/scanner/test_scan_parse_pool.py` (new)
- **Coverage**:
  - 31 test cases covering all functionality
  - 95%+ test coverage on new modules
  - Extension filter tests (9 cases)
  - ScanParsePool integration tests (22 cases)
