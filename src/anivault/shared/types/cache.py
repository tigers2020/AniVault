and deserialization.

Focus Areas:
- SQLite row â†’ Pydantic model conversion
- JSON serialization/deserialization safety
- Cache key type definitions

# Note: Using simple assignment instead of TypeAlias for Python 3.9 compatibility

# NOTE: Cache entry models will be added in Task 5 (Cache Serialization Refactor)
# NOTE: orjson serialization helpers defined in ModelConverter (Task 2)
