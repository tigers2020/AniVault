"""Signal Connection Coordinator.

This module provides SignalCoordinator, which centrally manages all signal
connections between MainWindow and its components (StateModel, Controllers, Views).

Design Pattern:
    - Follows the manager pattern for centralized signal management
    - Groups signal connections by component for clarity
    - Provides connect_all() for initialization and disconnect_all() for cleanup
    - Does NOT inherit from QObject as it only manages connections

Usage:
    Signal connections are organized into logical groups:
    - StateModel signals (2): files_updated, file_status_changed
    - View signals (1): groupSelected
    - ScanController signals (5): scan_started, scan_progress, etc.
    - TMDBController signals (7): matching_started, file_matched, etc.
    - OrganizeController signals (1): plan_generated

Example:
    >>> coordinator = SignalCoordinator(main_window)
    >>> coordinator.connect_all()
    >>> # Later, when cleaning up:
    >>> coordinator.disconnect_all()
