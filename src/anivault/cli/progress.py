Progress Display Utility Module

This module provides a centralized system for displaying progress bars and spinners
for long-running operations in the AniVault CLI. It wraps the Rich library's
progress functionality to provide a simple, consistent interface.

The ProgressManager class offers:
- Determinate progress tracking for finite sequences
- Indeterminate progress display (spinners) for unknown duration tasks
- Conditional disabling for non-interactive modes or JSON output
- Consistent styling and formatting across all commands
